## Announcements

11/07/2022:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setup, DI, logging and more has changed and introduced, we are working to get all the systems back and running.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vulkan boilerplate is done and needs to be refined and adjusted to our needs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(current status can be found [here](https://github.com/exomia/framework/tree/feature/linux)).  

16/09/2021:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exomia/framework will make the move to be a modern and cross platform framework in the future.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will support windows and linux at the start (current status can be found [here](https://github.com/exomia/framework/tree/feature/linux)).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we will change the graphics api and so we will move from DirectX to Vulkan.  

Stay tuned for more information in the future!
